### What C# code do you want to flag and why?


### Does the new rule enforce a best practice in C#/.NET or just a coding style?


### In which versions of C#/.NET does the flagged syntax/API exist? Please provide a link.
[example for `String.Split` Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split)


### How should the code be fixed?


### How do you think the nearby whitespaces and comments should be updated? Please provide a minimal code example.


### Have you checked if this can be flagged by [built-in code analysis rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/categories) or existing NuGet packages like [`Roslynator.Analyzers`](https://github.com/dotnet/roslynator), [`StyleCop.Analyzers`](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers), or [`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers`](https://microsoft.github.io/vs-threading/analyzers/index.html)?
